Welcome to my website! My name is Carl Amko and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Florida.
I primarily enjoy creating and developing software of all kinds.
I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.immersedgames.com">Immersed Games</a> which has a focus on developing and expanding the realm of educational gaming.
I am also a co-founder of an independent gaming studio started amongst a close group of old friends. 
We produces small games from various genres, from board games to digital puzzle games. <br> <br>
As a hobby, I mostly enjoy coding and video gaming in my spare time. However, I also love to play Ultimate Frisbee and have recently begun to run recreationally.
