            I have over 7 years of experience as a software engineer at multiple high-growth organizations.
            My expertise is in building cloud backend services, applications, APIs, and tools
            that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and maintainable. I also have several years of experience 
            developing and testing Android applications.

        <p>
           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
