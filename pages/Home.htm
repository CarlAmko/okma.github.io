My name is Carl Amko and my primary focus is designing and developing software of all kinds - including applications, games, and websites.
I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a style="color: #0099FF" target="_blank" href="https://www.immersedgames.com">Immersed Games</a> which has a focus on developing and expanding the realm of educational gaming.
My responsibilities include implementing various forms of complex Artificial Intelligence with robust design patterns, designing multi-threaded architecture for drastically improved parallel performance, and developing core, macro gameplay systems.
I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.<br> <br>
I also co-founded an independent gaming studio wth a close-knit group of friends from high school.
We designed and produced small games of various genres, from board games to digital puzzle games.<br> <br>
As a hobby, I mostly enjoy coding new projects and video gaming with friends in my spare time. I also love to play Ultimate Frisbee and have recently begun to run recreationally. If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to check out the sections below.
