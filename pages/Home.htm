My name is Carl Amko and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.
My primary focus is designing and developing software of all kinds - including applications, games, and websites.
I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a style="color: #0099FF" target="_blank" href="https://www.immersedgames.com">Immersed Games</a> which has a focus on developing and expanding the realm of educational gaming. My responsibilities have included implementing various forms of complex Artificial Intelligence, designing multi-threaded architecture for drastically improved parallel performance, and developing core gameplay systems on a macro level.<br> <br>
I am also a co-founder of an independent gaming studio started amongst a close-knit group of old friends from high school.
We produce small games of various genres, from board games to digital puzzle games. <!-- You can check it out <a style="color: #0099FF" target="_blank" href="http://byteusgaming.com">here</a>. --> <br> <br>
As a hobby, I mostly enjoy coding (of course) and video gaming with friends in my spare time. I also love to play Ultimate Frisbee and have recently begun to run recreationally. If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to check out the sections below.
