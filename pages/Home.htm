Welcome to my website! My name is Carl Amko and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Florida.
My primary focus is designing and developing software of all kinds.
I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a style="color: #0099FF" target="_blank" href="https://www.immersedgames.com">Immersed Games</a> which has a focus on developing and expanding the realm of educational gaming. My responsibilities have included implementing various forms of complex Artificial Intelligence, designing multi-threaded architecture for drastically improved performance, and developing core gameplay systems on a macro level.<br> <br>
I am also a co-founder of an independent gaming studio started amongst a close-knit group of old friends from high school.
We produce small games from various genres, from board games to digital puzzle games. I'm currently redesigning our company's website, so stay tuned for its release! You can see it <a style="color: #0099FF" target="_blank" href="http://byteusgaming.com">here</a>. <br> <br>
As a hobby, I mostly enjoy coding (of course) and video gaming with friends in my spare time. I also love to play Ultimate Frisbee and have recently begun to run recreationally. If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to check out the sections below!
